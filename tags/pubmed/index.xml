      <description>Hi athletes, today we will be looking at data about a health issue that affects many athletes: athlete&amp;rsquo;s foot. It&amp;rsquo;s not a very glamorous subject but it&amp;rsquo;s still interesting, and I find fungi really fascinating, they are warrior eukaryotes that survive everywhere! Most of you probably would rather never hear about it&amp;hellip; but you should. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, it is generally a fungal infection on the feet referred to as &amp;ldquo;tinea pedis&amp;rdquo; but can be something else that causes inflammation on the foot of an athlete, however the definitions vary according to who you talk to&amp;hellip; I am going to stick to the more accepted definition which is the fungal infection.</description>
