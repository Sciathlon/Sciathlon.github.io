      <description>Hello athletes, welcome on my new platform Sciathlon. The goal for this website is to share findings in sports science and technology. I am a biologist so I am interested in everything related with an athlete&amp;rsquo;s health such as nutrition, genetics, injuries and conditions related to the kind of activity we do. Some sports involve animals, so I will also be covering their health in this context. I am also interested in the technology involved in sports such as equipment but also training and performance analysis programmes and apps.</description>
