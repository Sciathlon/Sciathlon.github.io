      <description>TheGingerRunner  If you are interested in running and want to learn more about trails, races, athletes, training, gear, nutrition, there are amazing ressources out there that will teach and inspire you. I have compiled a little list of my favorite youtube channels that I have been following for years. The first one is my absolute favorite, it inspires me so much. The channel is called TheGingerRunner and is owned by Ethan Newberry.</description>
