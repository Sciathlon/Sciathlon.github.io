      <description>Hi everyone!
I ran my first half marathon this spring and wanted to talk about my experience. I also analyzed the results of the race which I found on the Grenoble-Vizille website, so scroll down if you want to only look at the data science part of this article. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been running regularly for a year, and I&amp;rsquo;d been dreaming about this day since I started. It was still kind of a dream for the longest time, something that I wanted but was still only a concept until the day arrived and I realized: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m running a half marathon today.</description>
