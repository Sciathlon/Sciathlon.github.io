      <description>Hello everybody, I have a new run data analysis today: from my own strava data! I have been much slower recently on the posts, I will probably be until the end of july, because of work for my PhD, so I&amp;rsquo;m sorry about that. I am using the rStrava package and the tutorial in its readme file to get my strava data and see how much my running has changed since a year ago when I started.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone!
I am tackling a new topic today, which is: waste generated during races. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you why this is coming up now. I started the racing season with a road 10km called Asparun which was a relatively small race, 354 runners on the 10k plus probably as many on the 5k, which is more people than I usually see at my small local races, and I saw so many people just throwing their water goblets not IN the trash but sometimes 500 meters away, and it shocked me.</description>

      <title>My first half marathon and its data analysis</title>

      <description>Hi everyone!
I ran my first half marathon this spring and wanted to talk about my experience. I also analyzed the results of the race which I found on the Grenoble-Vizille website, so scroll down if you want to only look at the data science part of this article. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been running regularly for a year, and I&amp;rsquo;d been dreaming about this day since I started. It was still kind of a dream for the longest time, something that I wanted but was still only a concept until the day arrived and I realized: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m running a half marathon today.</description>
