      <description>The 2018 Winter Olympics finally kicked off! In honor of this, I asked a friend of mine who loves sports what data he would be interested in seeing in the sports that are in the winter Olympics and he answered &amp;ldquo;biathlon.&amp;rdquo; I found a website that collects lots of data on the sport called biathlonresults.com. I was really looking forward to the olympics this year, and France has a very famous biathlete, Martin Fourcade, so that makes me keen to look more into this sport.</description>
