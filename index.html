  <p class="post-summary">Hi everyone!
I ran my first half marathon this spring and wanted to talk about my experience. I also analyzed the results of the race which I found on the Grenoble-Vizille website, so scroll down if you want to only look at the data science part of this article. I’ve only been running regularly for a year, and I’d been dreaming about this day since I started. It was still kind of a dream for the longest time, something that I wanted but was still only a concept until the day arrived and I realized: “I’m running a half marathon today.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">The 2018 Winter Olympics finally kicked off! In honor of this, I asked a friend of mine who loves sports what data he would be interested in seeing in the sports that are in the winter Olympics and he answered “biathlon.” I found a website that collects lots of data on the sport called biathlonresults.com. I was really looking forward to the olympics this year, and France has a very famous biathlete, Martin Fourcade, so that makes me keen to look more into this sport.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Today I am using the RISmed package which I love, to look through the Pubmed database for what they have on triathlon. Pubmed is a NIH (USA) funded database which hosts articles about medicine and biology, so I am looking at studies that have been done on injuries and disease and human physiology that have to do with triathlon. I am not a triathlete yet, I am just focusing on running and I cycle to commute to the lab and swim as cross training every once in a while and I am planning on starting with a duathlon this summer and maybe casual triathlons next year because I want to focus on running this year.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Today I am writing another piece about figure skating, also another piece about data analysis in this event. But I am not focusing solely on the Olympics this time but on the best scoring athletes and the best scoring event of each athlete. There is a lot of data to go through, so let’s get right into it! The data comes from the (International skating Union) website which I downloaded on the 20/01/2018 (if you try my code and the results are different it might be because the data on the website has changed).</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Analysing medals won per athlete/per country with R Today I am introducing a sneaky little data analysis using R on figure skating in the olympics. I have already written a piece on Figure skating and what I think is going to happen in the upcoming olympics. But I also want to look back at athletes who have competed and won a medal in the past Olympics. If you’ve never heard of data science, this is how you can make very easy analysis of your favorite things in the world!</p>

  <p class="post-summary">The winter olympics are coming! It is an exciting time to celebrate our favorite sports and feel inspired to do better ourselves. It is going to be interesting this year with the doping ban for Russia as well as many unfortunate injuries and retirements. Figure skating is my favorite event because it is an incredibly beautiful and hard sport that I practised for a few years when I was young. It has been a sport in the Olympics since the first one in 1924 in Chamonix, France, and is often complained about because they are not measuring a time but are looking at technical and artistic components of the sport which can be very unfair.</p>

    <p class="post-meta">@Sciathlete · Jan 10, 2018 · 3 min read</p>
  </header>
  
  <p class="post-summary">I started skiing at the age of 3 at the station in the Alps called the “Sept Laux” next to Grenoble, France. It was natural to me, but until now I never wondered for how long people have done it. Here is a brief history of how it all began.
The word ski comes from old Norse, a germanic language that was spoken in Scandinavia from the 8th to the late 14th century.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">It’s skiing season and I’m very excited about it except… I can’t ski because I busted my knees. However I am still very curious to know what makes what skis are made of, and what is the difference between a beginner ski and a pro ski, like we can expect to see at the olympics in Febuary this year.
So, without getting in detail about the history of skis (which you can find in this blog post ), they used to be made entirely of wood.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">TheGingerRunner  If you are interested in running and want to learn more about trails, races, athletes, training, gear, nutrition, there are amazing ressources out there that will teach and inspire you. I have compiled a little list of my favorite youtube channels that I have been following for years. The first one is my absolute favorite, it inspires me so much. The channel is called TheGingerRunner and is owned by Ethan Newberry.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Hello athletes, welcome on my new platform Sciathlon. The goal for this website is to share findings in sports science and technology. I am a biologist so I am interested in everything related with an athlete’s health such as nutrition, genetics, injuries and conditions related to the kind of activity we do. Some sports involve animals, so I will also be covering their health in this context. I am also interested in the technology involved in sports such as equipment but also training and performance analysis programmes and apps.</p>
