<li>TheGingerRunner</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are interested in running and want to learn more about trails, races, athletes, training, gear, nutrition, there are amazing ressources out there
that will teach and inspire you. I have compiled a little list of my favorite
youtube channels that I have been following for years. The first one is my absolute favorite, it inspires me so much. The
channel is called TheGingerRunner and is owned by Ethan Newberry. He does interviews of pros every week in his GingerRunner Live show on monday
nights which give you advice, news on people and races, overview of races, and really cool stories. He also reviews tons of different shoes all the time, which
will teach you about the vocabulary of running shoes, and tell you what to look for in them.
He reviews other types of gear as well. But what will make you love his channel is his amazing skills as filmmaker. He is brutally honest and raw in his videos, which
I appreciate. The quality of his movies and other videos is amazing, even his earlier videos. I encourage you to watch his earliest GingerRunner Live show, because
the pros he interviews then are giving the more basic tips and when you are just starting out, that helps a lot. Also check out his wife&rsquo;s channel, MileLongLegs,
though she isn&rsquo;t uploading a lot, I still think she deserves support and encouragement because she is awesome.</p>

<ol>
<li>Triathlon Taren</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a pretty new channel, Taren started his channel in 2015 and he produces very good quality videos every single day, they are
fun and entertaining to watch but they also teach you a lot. He has been doing triathlon for over 7 years, has his own coach and really
knows what he is doing. He makes videos on specific training drills, covers famous international races, does podcasts&hellip; it is simply
amazing! He also loves stats and analyses them off of an excel sheet for you.</p>

<ol>
<li>global triathlon network and global cyclist network</li>
</ol>

<p>Two amazing sister channels that I love, there&rsquo;s something about their british humour that makes you both laugh your head off and face-palm
at the same time. But GTN produce amazing content every day, and they have a special show every wednesday where
they go over triathlon news and interview pro athletes, and their fun little segments of GTN pain cave where people send
pictures of their indoor training setup, and their caption competition are entertaining. Even though they are really strong athletes, you feel connected to them
in that
they are also still learning about this extreme sport. The mother channel is GCN and it is so helpful for everything to do with road cycling: where to get gear, how to pick it, what drills
are better, how to take care of your bike&hellip; it is also really amazing. Just like GTN, it does feature suspicious british humour, but it&rsquo;s slightly
worse than GTN humor. So you will definitely love it!</p>

<p>For now that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got but I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for new channels to watch so if you have any favorites let me know! See you next time!</p>
