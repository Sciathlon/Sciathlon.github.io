    <article class="post-content"><p>The winter olympics are coming! And with it the giddy excitement to see our inspiring favorite athletes. It is going to be interesting with the doping bans,
many unfortunate injuries, and retirements. Figure skating is my favorite event because it is an incredibly beautiful and hard sport and I would know because
I practised it for a few years. For a few years now
Russian figure skating was always my favorite because their figure skating athletes are really amazing and their choreography beautiful. But
they won&rsquo;t have as much success this year I think as some of their best athletes left. I was very sad to find out that Yulia
Lipnitskaya was retiring from the sport after an amazing win for Russia Team 4 years
ago, she was especially great in her short programs. Adelina Sotnikova, who won the ladie&rsquo;s event back then is a good candidate but might be
shadowed by Evgenia Medvedeva who already won the world championships twice at 17 years old, if they accept to compete under no flag&hellip;
On the mens&rsquo; side, Evgeni Plushenko of course had already
not finished the last games due to injury, and has also retired from the sport, and I don&rsquo;t think they are going to win that event this year.
France has a solid chance of winning the ice dancing event, with the Gabriella Papadakis / Guillaume Cizeron pair&rsquo;s latest success, which I admit makes me proud.
Canada is  going to have a solid performance as usual, and we can expect great things from South Korea as well. Synchronized skating is not yet included but I
am excited to see it coming perhaps 4 years from now!</p>

<p>I am really looking forward to this event, and hope that the athletes are going to amaze us again! Who do you think is going to win in Figure Skating?</p>

<p>See you next time sciathletes!</p>
